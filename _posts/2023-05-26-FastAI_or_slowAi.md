# Question 3 woes
## First go
originally, question 3 was thought to be impossible for me, codespace and fastai in the last week of uni just didn't want to work or run. 
Always crashing whenever I just start to make progress and then I'd have to train the models all over again (mainly an issue with Q3 due to to time it takes)

## Second go
Managed to have a real attempt, but silly me I didn't realise to think how long resising 100,000 images would take when trying to train the model for fake and real images.
I managed to learn from that mistake to atleast get two models in the end with different architectures to show a little bit of comparison.
